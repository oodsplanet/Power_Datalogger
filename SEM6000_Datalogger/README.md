Log Voltage, Powerconsumption, Current on an a SD-Card which is connected by a Voltrcaft-SEM6000
measureing power socket. 
Data is read from teh socket via BLE Bluetooth with an ESP32-NodeMCU-Board
Data is stored on a SD-card connected to the ESP32 via SPI bus
It is running in AcessPoint-mode and can be controlled by any browser
 
The SEM6000 does only log consumption "per hour" in resolution of >= 1hour.
With this you can log at least every 2 seconds to a text file on the SD-card

Since this is my irst project please send, add  sugegstions and don't change the code directly
